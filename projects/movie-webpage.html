            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>Mr Mueller assigned us the movie webpage project. He paired us up into twos. We had to use HTML and CSS to help make a movie webpage about anything we wanted. Me and my partner chose to do horror about a haunted house.  </p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>For our movie webpage, we were given a rubric to follow. On it, it stated that we had to use multiple skills from HTML and CSS. Some of these were, paragraphs, headers, divs and spans, elemnts, classes, ids, padding and much more. It also required images that suited our theme of what we were making the movie about. Me and my partner decided to split things up so I worked on the HTML while he worked on the CSS. </p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>Some challenges that we had were making the images centered. I remember I had put in the divs and my partner tried to center one of the images. However, the code did not work. We called Mr Mueller and asked for assistance. The 3 of us tried to figure out why the code for centering was not working though it worked for our texts. Eventually after we dived deeper into the coding, we figured it was because of the div taking up space in the line. When the div was in use, it took up all the space, leaving no room for the normal centering code to work. Mr Mueller then used a code that could center the image without disrupting the div. </p>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Something that I took away from this project was that communication was important. Without communication with my partner, we would have been messing up our roles and being confused. Instead, I remember he reminded me to do my writing for continuation of the story. He also alerted me whenever he thought the story wasn't quite finished, and so did I when I thought maybe the color schemes didn't match as well, or maybe the images he found were'nt the best. Overall, I think communication played a big factor because without it, we would have been really confused on everything and having to keep our opinions bottled up. </p>
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>For my next steps, I would like to learn more about CSS because I figured that when we were assigning the roles, I asked for HTML because I thought it could be simpler. But, throughout the expierence I also learned alot from my partners role because I tried to help him every so often. Next time, I would like to be braver and not just volunteer for a spot because I think it can be easier. THis also requires me to know more about both HTML and CSS so I wish to learn more. However, I still thought that this was a very fun project because we could choose our story line based off our own creativity.  </p>
